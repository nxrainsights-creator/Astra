Config
If you're already using NPM and a module bundler such as webpack or Rollup, you can run the following command to install the latest SDK (Learn more):

npm install firebase
Then, initialise Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products that you'd like to use.

// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyBLogsJmDhAbBYWAaa9RFg4Vd0gyiT81iA",
  authDomain: "nxra-portal.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "nxra-portal",
  storageBucket: "nxra-portal.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "1084781179957",
  appId: "1:1084781179957:web:d45e5c46fd90f719286d7c",
  measurementId: "G-VKKXZ67TNX"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
Note: This option uses the modular JavaScript SDK, which provides a reduced SDK size.
